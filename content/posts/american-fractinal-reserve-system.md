##  Implimentation of American Fractional Reserve System in Solana




```Blog and Code in production :)```

### History

Modeled in 1660s, Fractional reserve banking lead to the invention of paper money.

A economic institution of the government initialised to manage the total supply of U.S Dollars 
which includes creation of fresh money too [not minting].

There are blockchain protocols building under FRB system but not preferred. Since, the fluctuations can cause adverseral damage to ones collateral unless its a *stablecoin*. But core reason of Marka is to understand the mathematical indications and reservational transactions.

### What is FRB

In the paper world, a central bank institutionalised by the government has the authority to print money. Pulled into circulation via bonds or securities.

Consider a commercial/private under which the sellers deposit the paper money. The bank follows *Fractional Feserve Lending* [FRL] where it keeps only fraction of the reserve and lends the rest to other business/people as loans, etc. 

If Alice deposits $10 into Bank A at a reserve rate of 10% the bank lends the rest of the money, that is $9 to Bob who inturn deposits it into Bank B which reserves a fraction (3%) and lends the remaining $8.73 of into Clara depositing it into Bank C.

The system now has escalated into a total amount of $27.73 from $10. This is knows as the *Money Multiplier Theory*

>The money multiplier measures the maximum amount of money that commercial banks can create by a given unit of central bank money. In other words, the total amount of loans that commercial banks are allowed to extend is a multiple of the reserves and this multiple is the inverse of the reserve ratio.

One important requirement of this system in Cryptoworld is that there is no legal protection for crypto assets, pulling a backup from governance/Foundations/operators requires following a nested requirments which is not immediate and takes quite a while to bring into action. Where as with reserves, an automated balance is maintained.
 

##  [Marka](https://github.com/Marka-protocol/marka)

Introducing [*Marka*](https://github.com/Marka-protocol/marka),  a dAPP designed as a replication of Fractional Lending (and Borrowing) system including reserve ratios, treasuries [vault] and multiplier effect or yield aggregation. Marka will be open source and public while mapping each progresion into this blog post on a motto that the end result has to be top notch. May it be a program that adds 2 numbers or intersects two chain gotta show standards
