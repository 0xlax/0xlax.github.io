The new smart contract language developed at FB now being used in various 
promising L1s like [aptos]("www.aptoslabs.com"),Sui and many others.

Move has language syntax adopted from rust, infact it entirely follows 
Rust paramaters along with Cargo package manager although there is an Move's 
independent package manager in development.

compiler support for Solana.
