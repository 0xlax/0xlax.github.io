### Hello! I'm **Lax**, a freelance blockchain developer 

I started a career into blockchain when I found Ethereum on Thiel Fellowship page and as a 17 year old web developer the term "**blockchain**" and "**digital decentralisation**" really caught my attention. Eventually drifted towards Solana


And this where i started digging deeper into blockchain tech, methodologies and fascinated by how machines communicate. I try to come up with my own advancements of a concept or a create an entirely new version. This site is to keep a track of it.
