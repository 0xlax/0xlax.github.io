title = "About Me"

My name is Harshith ( **Lax** on the internet :p ) 

I started a career into blockchain when I found Ethereum on Thiel Fellowship page and as a 17 year old web developer the term "**blockchain**" and "**digital decentralisation**" really caught my attention. Eventually drifted towards Solana (cuz rust &#128527;)

For the past 12 years, I've been working with a wide range of tools, methodologies and frameworks. As a designer, I focus on a great user experience trying to create intuitive user interfaces. And as a developer, I try to deliver them in the best possible way.

And this where i started digging deeper into blockchain tech, methodologies and fascinated by how machines communicate. I try to come up with my own advancements of a concept or a create an entirely new version. This site is to keep a track of it.
