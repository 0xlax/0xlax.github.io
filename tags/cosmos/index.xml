&lt;p>Ever since I watched the Consensus2022 presentation by &lt;a href="https://www.twitter.com/robviglione">Rob Viglione&lt;/a> about zkSNARKs, made me curious how Horizen plans its scalability. This blog is a short deep dive into Horizen Blockchain and relevent comparisions.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Horizen is a general-purpose blockchain system with novel Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP) that enables an unbound and fully
decentralized sidechain ecosystem&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A peer-to-peer, permissionless and incentivised network that enables you to build a custom blockchain and applicaiton on the layer using Sidechain-SDK, a development kit devised to deploy a blockchain with fully customisable features and Dapps using Horizen&amp;rsquo;s scalability and extenisbility. Multiple convocations of sidechains (parallel chains) transmit messages to each other and the mainchain via CCTP.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As of writing, Horizen has 45k active nodes running with an stake requirement of 42 $ZEN at an average price of $15.08 and estimated earning per node of about $4.17 ($50.75 a year)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Horizen has an intense focus on enabling zero-knowledge protocol to let application verify information without revealing the information itself. This helps companies building supply chains on Horizen share product data with customers without revealing sensitive information,
like identities of people involved in supply chain or locations of factories&lt;/p>

&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>Horizen protocols focus on maximum functionality rather than design by following Bitcoin&amp;rsquo;s core alongside the &lt;a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/946.pdf">Equihash Proof-of-Work&lt;/a> with &lt;a href="https://www.horizen.io/assets/files/A-Penalty-System-for-Delayed-Block-Submission-by-Horizen.pdf">Delayed block penalty algorithm&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Equihash Proof of Work mining algorithm is a class of hash function like &lt;a href="https://eth.wiki/en/concepts/ethash/ethash">ETHash&lt;/a> solving computational intensive and memory intensive problems to generate the proof but in an instant. Nice trade ;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Equihash is also used by ZCash, Bitcoin Gold and known for being &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit">ASIC-resistant&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Uses BLAKE2b to compute 50 MB hash dataset from the previous blocks in the blockchain (until the current block).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Solves the &amp;ldquo;Generalized Birthday Problem&amp;rdquo; over the generated hash dataset (pick 512 different strings from 2097152, such that the binary &amp;gt;XOR of them is zero). The best known solution (Wagner&amp;rsquo;s algorithm) runs in exponential time, so it requires a lot of memory-intensive and &amp;gt;computing-intensive calculations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Double SHA256 the solution to compute the final hash.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>uses proof-of-stake consensus protocol since mining corporations consider &lt;a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Mining_hardware_comparison">ASIC miners&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP)
&lt;a href="#cross-chain-transfer-protocol-cctp" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;img src="https://0xlax.github.io/img/cctp.png" alt="CCTP" class="center" />
&lt;p>The above self-explanatory image depicts how CCTP works i.e, providing safe and secure coin transfer invocations between mainchain and the sidechain. &amp;ldquo;Transfer&amp;rdquo; of coins in this scenario is a process of burning and recreating the coins under different chains (either mainchain to sidechain or vice versa) with same metadata attached regarding the end destinations. Just like a regular transactions as in Bitcoin and Ethereum, the chains use UTXO but with specific sidechain output (for initial transactions). A sidechain is a multi-feature customisable chain that runs parallel to the mainchain.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Basically, a 2-way protocol that performs 2 operations:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Forward Transfer&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Backward Transfer&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>All this might sounds familiar if you have been a cryptodev for a while&amp;hellip; COSMOS!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cosmos uses IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication protocol) and CosmosSDK while Horizon uses CCTP and SidechainSDK. Though the functionality between IBC and CCTP are similar with respect to multichain interoperability, there are vast differences between them which is explained later.&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="sidechains">
Sidechains
&lt;a href="#sidechains" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h4>
&lt;p>A Horizen sidechain architecture is built using 3 components. Based on the designed, components can be hight coupled or decoupled so it works independent from any particular sidechain implementation.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Mainchain consensus protocol (MCP)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cross-Chain Transfer Protocol (CCTP)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sidechain Consensus protocol (SCP)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Multipurposeness in a sidechain can be achieved by designing a system so that MCP and SCP are completely &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.05441">decoupled&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>IBC is an interoperability protocol for communicating arbitrary data between arbitrary state machines.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>IBC is an end-to-end, connection-oriented, state-
ful protocol for reliable, ordered, and authenticated communication between modules on
separate distributed ledgers&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The protocol consists of two distinct layers: the transport layer (TAO) which provides the necessary infrastructure to establish secure connections and authenticate data packets between chains, and the application layer, which defines exactly how these data packets should be packaged and interpreted by the sending and receiving chains. IBC brings Cosmos closer to a truly interoperable ecosystem&lt;/p>
&lt;p>IBC is a trustless bridge protocol that utilizes light clients, and cryptographic proofs to ensure
that the bridge has the same trust assumptions as the zones it bridges. This differs
significantly from oracle- or witness-based bridges, which rely on a small number of trusted
parties to verify that an event has taken place.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr">2/ IBC is a protocol that allows blockchains to talk to each other. 🙌 That means being able to transfer tokens and other data frictionlessly and trustlessly between previously unconnected blockchains.

&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>In proof-of-stake blockchain, asset holders wuishing to stake their tokens in order to earn staking rewards are required to lock their capital. This locked capital, knows as deligation, acts as slashable security deposit in the event that their chosen validators should misbehave.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Proof-of-Stake chosen over Proof-of-Work since they are faster, provides higher performance, Environmental sustaility and larger design space for economic incentives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Staking with Cosmos (mostly includes proof-of-stake protocols) includes :&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Delegator&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Validator&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Validator runs hardware and a blockchain building using Cosmos SDK to propose blocks in consensus. Delegators put up capital in form of the chain&amp;rsquo;s native staking token by way of security deposit&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a recompense for provoding security deposits, the delegators earn staking rewards proportional to value of their staked asets for each block validated. Validators in turn charge a commision upon these reqards for providing the validator service.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Cosmos-SDK networks is five percent, leaving 95 percent of capital illiquid
and unutilized.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h3 id="liquid-staking">
Liquid Staking
&lt;a href="#liquid-staking" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Liquids (crosschain assets) can be transferred, traded or utilised and this is implemented via set of smart contracts where the user deposits tokens in smart contract and some validators acting on behalf of the protocol are then delegated to by smart contract themselves.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Derivative staked tokens are a claim to the underlying, illiquid staking positions that
remain exposed to above mentioned protocol limitations. These tokenized and thus liquid
representations of a claim can be used in various financial products. This means stakers
could earn additional yields or easily manage their risk exposure in various ways, e.g. with
respect to slashing risks associated with validators. We will expand on this type of
composability and highlight the potential benefits and risks of tokenized staking
positions in decentralized finance after introducing our taxonomy of liquid staking
approaches.

How Interchain Liquid Staking Works
&lt;a href="#how-interchain-liquid-staking-works" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Since IBC was introduced, a new whole realm of oppurtunity was opened for developers to create a way to let users transfer, stake and transact assets of one chain throught a trustless bridge protocol using light clients and cryptographic proofs independent on oracles which only relies on small number of trusted providers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Interchain Accounts:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An application which enables IBC protocol having an Interchain Account (&lt;a href="https://github.com/cosmos/ibc/blob/master/spec/app/ics-027-interchain-accounts/README.md">ICS27&lt;/a>) which lets accounts on Network A be controlled by Netwirk B&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Consisting on a Host and Contorller chain, the Controller chaon is able to register an account on Host chain by way of opening a dedicated IBC channel between the two chains.Interhcina assets staking protocols like quicksliver or interhcina asset AMM liek Osmosis increase the efficiency of delegating tokens on behalf users in turn minting a tokenized representation of users&amp;rsquo;s dekegations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An interrchain staking for each chain will generate and control a deposit amount and number of delegation buckets by way of the interchain Accounts IBC module&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This lets you deposit so as to recieve the transfer if tokenized delegation shares. Upon receipt of transfer into the deposit accounts, the corresponding address on the interchain staking chain will be credit with the appropriate asset of the value of the transferred delegation shares.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given that validators are free to choose their own commission rates, a delegation to validator
A does not provide the same rewards over period T as an equal delegation to validator B. In
order to ensure fungibility between validators, we must be able to treat all delegations as
equal. In order to achieve this, we must socialize rewards such that all qAsset holders will
receive the same Asset rewards (that is, the collective Asset/qAsset redemption rate
will increase) as one other, regardless of the validators with whom they choose to delegate.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="risk-socialization-and-slashing">
Risk Socialization and Slashing
&lt;a href="#risk-socialization-and-slashing" class="h-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Given that validators are independent, run different hardware and software configurations and are run by different teams with different experience and priorities, the risk profile of each validator is different. In order to maintain fungibility, this risk must also be socialized. A slashing event for one Asset validator is therefore borne by all qAsset holders through a negative movement in the Asset:qAsset redemption rate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Given sufficient decentralization across validators, slashing events are hedged against.
The outcome of such a double-sign slash (5%) for an average (1% of managed supply)
validator, will lead to a 0.05% reduction in the redemption rate; similarly, the same validator
being jailed for downtime (0.1%) will lead to a 0.001% reduction in the rate&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>In conclusion, it is clear that liquid staking is critical for the health of the staking paradigm, in
a world where better returns are available for an asset holder outside of delegation. Desigining an incentivised decentralisation protocol for interhcian liquid staking might ensure solid liquid staking solution on Cosmos.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
